This project is currently not functional.

## Installation

* Clone the repository locally.
* `bin/composer install`
* Visit http://127.0.0.1/index.php

It will lead you to the login page. At the bottom you will see a link that leads you to the index page.

`/login` is the login page.
`/index` is the index page. 

There is a file to fill the database, you can execute `php src/Fixtures.php` but it doesn't work, there is an error somewhere in the code. Apparently the
namespaces don't work properly.
